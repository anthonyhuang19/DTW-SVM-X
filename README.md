# Evaluation-Kernel-Using-Timeserie-Dataset
Support vector machine(SVM) is an advanced classifier for multidimensional data. To make SVM
meaningful and effective for processing time series data, we need to select an appropriate kernel for
SVM. An appropriate kernel for SVM relies on both a suitable kernel function and an appropriate
distance metric. In this article, we will use dynamic time wrapping(DTW) as the distance metric to
incorporate into different kernel functions(Cauchy, Gaussian, inverse multiquadric, Laplacian, Log
and Rational quadratic) to compare the performance of different SVM kernel with DTW on time
series classification.
